## üé® Illustration Style Guide

### 1. **Format & Composition**

-   **Panel proportions**: Use a 1024:888 frame for all card art.
-   **Central focus**: Prioritize a clear, dominant subject‚Äîship, planet, device, or character‚Äîwith minimal distractions.
-   **Clean framing**: Avoid ornate borders‚Äîthink like a comic or field notebook panel.

### 2. **Linework**

-   **Ink style**: Crisp, consistent black (or dark charcoal) outlines with subtle brush variation‚Äînothing super-heavy or soft-sketchy.
-   **Line weight**: Medium weight‚Äîthin enough for detail, thick enough to read at small scale.

### 3. **Color & Texture**

-   **Palette**: Muted, slightly desaturated tones‚Äîsteel greys, beige, terra-cotta or soft red accents. Backgrounds may have pale blues, greens, or dusty browns.
-   **Fill style**: Use soft brush textures (watercolor washes, digital airbrush), staying within line boundaries.
-   **Weathering**: Light wear touches‚Äîscratches, panel seams, oil marks, chipped paint‚Äîto add charm and history.

### 4. **Detail & Styling**

-   **Techno-functional**: Illustrate visible cargo pods, vents, thrusters, wires, bolts‚Äîbut skip unnecessary weaponry or overt mechanical complexity.
-   **Friendly design**: Rounded edges, warm tones, approachable shapes‚Äînothing harsh or militaristic.
-   **Symbolic details**: Small logos, numbering, or field marks included as part of world-building, but keep them subtle.

### 5. **Mood & Tone**

-   **Charming realism**: Convey real-world functionality and scale but through a stylized lens.
-   **Science-log style**: It should feel like documentation‚Äîpurposeful, observant, with artistic flair.
-   **Not glossy nor dark**: No lens flares, neon, or gritty textures‚Äîkeep it clean, clear, and readable.

### 6. **Background Elements**

-   **Minimalist backdrop**: Stars, pale planet horizon, light nebula‚Äîjust enough to evoke space but not distract.
-   **Soft environments**: A dust cloud, ring glow, or asteroid field works if it informs context.
